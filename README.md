# Tenzies

Tenzies is a game in which players hold ten dice in their hands. Once the game begins everyone rolls at the same time. Player looks at the roll and decides which number you are going to go for based on such that the number appears on the maximum dice. Dice with that number are marked, and the remaining dice are rolled again till that number appears on these dice. Player needs to keep rolling until all ten of the dice show the same number.
